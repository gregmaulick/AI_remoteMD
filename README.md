# senior_design

This senior design project app was developed to bring medical care to patients who don't have accessible health care facilities; however, we only classify skin cancer for our senior design project. The goal of the app if it were to be implemented outside of the senior design project would be to let anyone with access to a phone use the app wherever they are by taking a picture of a potentially cancerous mole and receive a classification on the spot based on machine learning analysis clearly stating if the mole is cancerous or not. If the app diagnoses an image as malignant the patient then knows they should invest the time and money to get to the nearest doctor to have the mole checked and get the appropriate treatment. 

The final product we developed for our senior design project is only a prototype and proof-of-concept as a health app would need to receive FDA approval before being okayed to be used by the general public. We would need to devote more attention to exploring machine learning models to increase the accuracy of the classification and run thorough tests as a part of the process to achieve approval for an app like this. 

The product we developed is an app that users can take a picture of their mole with and then see the classification of the image they took, whether the mole is cancerous or not, on the app. We only classified Skin Cancer Images as cancerous or not, we did not classify if they were Melanoma or not.  The classification accuracy we achieved was about 82 percent so we recommend that the machine learning aspect of the project be further explored to find a model that achieves a higher accuracy. We used Flutter to develop our app and the random forest classifier for our machine learning model.  

IMPORTANT: PLEASE NOTE anywhere the word diagnose, diagnosis, diagnosed, or diagnoser is used in the app only means a classification of an image as cancerous (Malignant) or non-cancerous (Benign), it does not imply an official diagnosis.
